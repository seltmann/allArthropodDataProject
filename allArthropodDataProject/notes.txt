echo "select distinct country from occurrences_togo_NA order by country asc" | mysql -u seltmann -p -D scandata > occurrences_togo_NA_countries.tsv

187342 specimens had country = NULL and these were deleted from dataset, leaving 475733 remaining out of the 938,802

Highest occurrenceid in omocurrences is 25,558,348.
Lowest in  new data is 18,038,992 
So added 8,000,000 to the occid of the data imported into omocurrences.
New number range for the data is now between 32,882,146 and 26,038,992, which is outside of the range of the old data 25,558,348 and 8192. 

Then can just insert
INSERT INTO omoccurrences(SELECT * FROM occurrences_togo_NA);

New data received from Canadian collections. Looking for duplicates. TODO:
Incorporate new records (had added field)
Rerun all cleaning scripts
rerun taxonomy

Another problem is that sci name needs to be split into genus and species

ALTER TABLE `omcanada` ADD `familyOrder` VARCHAR(255) AFTER family;
Set the occid value for all in omcanada to null
