Data issues - 
1. both 0000-00-00 and NULL in db for eventDate with no date
2. scientificName includes author but not year
3. lots of stuff ended up in sciname that are not in scientificName. Creating 519,909 records with NULL in scientificName
4. 93,300 records have no determination. This includes in family, sciname or ScientificName fields.
5. over 3 million records do not have taxon rank filled out (cannot figure out higher taxonomy for those not determined to genus and below)
6. sciname and scientific name??

The limits are:
1. determined to species
2. number of species per family bins of <30, >30, >100 distinct collecting events that are georeferenced

family, number <30, number >30, >100, >500, >1000

select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced < 30 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 30 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 100 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 500 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 1000 group by family;
