# allArthropodDataProject github code. Whats in this folder is the same stuff that is on the github site.

The goal of this project is to evaluate all known arthropod data as of May 2015 to see where our community has research ready data. The limits of research ready data are:

1. specimens determined to species
2. number of species per family bins of <30, >30, >100, >500, >1000 distinct collecting events that are georeferenced

These will be broken down by functional groups of arthroods including pollinators, predators, and parasitoids.


Additional evaluation for data issues:
Data quality and normalization. Past known issues include:
1) lack of determination in scientificName
2) taxon rank not filled out
3) normalization of country codes
4) normalization of NULL values
