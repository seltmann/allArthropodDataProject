# allArthropodDataProject

The goal of this project is to evaluate all known arthropod data. We have a first draft that was presented at several meetings in 2014-2015. The new information starts July 2016.

#Data limits
	1. determined to species
	2. number of species per family bins of <30, >30, >100 distinct collecting events that are georeferenced

family, number <30, number >30, >100, >500, >1000

select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced < 30 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 30 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 100 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 500 group by family;
select family,count(*) from sums2 where georeferenced >= 1000 group by family;
